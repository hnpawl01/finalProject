		Education around the world is done differently depending on what country you live in. When finding why particular countries are ranked higher than others I was surprised to see that money had nothing to do with the rankings. The rankings were determined by the PISA scores that are taken by students of those countries. Also another determining factor was the enrollment percentages, which is demonstrated by the radius of the dots. The higher the enrollment the higher the ranking.
