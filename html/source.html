<a href = "https://data.worldbank.org/indicator?tab=all">First Source</a> is one of the websites I used. I got most of my datasets from this website. I believe they're a crediable source because it is the world banks information and is based on the data they have collected. Also they're a known government source that you can get data from. I used this for my gdp, gdpm on education, student teacher ratio, and spending per pupil.

<a href = "https://worldtop20.org/the-worlds-best-20-education-systems-rankings-third-quarter-report">Second Source</a> is another website I used. I got the rankings of each country from here. I believe they're crediable because they have current and a large amount of information on countries around the world.

<a href = "https://www.cpds-data.org/index.php/data">Third Source</a> is where I got government ratios from. I believed they're crediable because a lot of data on about the governments of the years they provide.
